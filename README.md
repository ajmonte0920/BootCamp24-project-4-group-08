Group Project #4 for Data Analytics and Visualization Bootcamp
Our project analyzes a dataset of over 16,000 movies from 1910 to 2024, sourced from Metacritic, to explore trends in movie ratings, popularity, and the impact of directors. The dataset includes movie titles, directors, ratings, and user votes, giving us a broad view of how audience reception has evolved. After extensive data cleaning—removing duplicates, handling missing values, and standardizing names—we created a relational database for easy querying by genre, director, and time period. Drawing inspiration from Netflix’s sleek, modern aesthetic, we designed the dashboard using dark, cinematic color schemes to make the data visually engaging. Machine learning models, like regression and clustering, helped us predict trends and reveal key patterns, including which directors consistently receive high ratings and which genres have grown in popularity. Our visualizations, such as bubble charts, heatmaps, and bar charts, highlight the relationship between director ratings, audience votes, and genre performance over time. Through this, we gained insights into audience preferences and industry shifts, though we also considered limitations like time-period and cultural biases. Overall, the project offers a rich analysis of how movie reception and success are shaped by both directors and genres.
